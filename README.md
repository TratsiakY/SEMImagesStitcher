# SEMImagesStitcher
A small Python class which allows to stich multiply SEM images 

The main problem here is extrymelly big ammount of possible points between images. Because of this, the standart approaches for SEM images stitching like high level stitching API from OpenCV do not work.

The algorythm is very simple and has a lot of points for improvement, but it works.
The result of images stitchind is demonstrated below
